> Thanks to AI, my understanding deepens as I keep playing one style. It's relatively easy to predict against other players who study AI.

> During a big game, I sometimes ponder, "If I were an AI, where would I place my move?". However, it's crucial to find my own best move. I think I should learn from AI and develop my unique strengths.

> It's undeniable that AI has provided immense help in advancing my Go skills. However, no matter how perfect the AI is, I believe there is still room for human spirit and competition to shine through. While playing Go, there are moves that the AI does not recommend, yet have a higher probability than what AI suggests. These moves may only come up once in a game, but I believe they represent human potential.
